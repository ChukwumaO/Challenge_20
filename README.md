## Solidity JointSavings smart contract

Using Solidity, I am built smart contracts to automate financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts.
To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, I have created a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Steps

1. Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity

2. Compile and Deploy the Contract

3. Interact with the Deployed Smart Contract
